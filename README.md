# Nigeria
Providing information on Nigeria for developers to use

# API
See [here](https://github.com/ezra-obiwale/Nigeria/tree/master/api)

# Collaboration

Collaborators are needed to provide more information on Nigeria. States and LGAs are already provided but a whole lot more can be done.

The intention here is to increase grow the API as the need arises. In light of this, if you find that you need to use certain information on Nigeria in your app which may be needed by other developers, you're welcome to add it here.
